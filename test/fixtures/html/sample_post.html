<p>Yesterday was a big day, and I nearly missed it, since I spent nearly all of the sunlight hours at the wheel of a car. Nine hours sitting on your butt is no way to ... oh wait, that's actually how I spend every day. Just usually not in a rental Hyundai. Never mind, I digress.
</p>

<p>It was a big day because <a href='http://nokogiri.rubyforge.org/nokogiri/'>Nokogiri</a> was released. I've spent quite a bit of time over the last couple of months working with <a href='http://tenderlovemaking.com/'>Aaron Patterson</a> (of <a href='http://rubyforge.org/projects/mechanize/'>Mechanize</a> fame) on this excellent library, and so I'm walking around, feeling satisfied.
</p>

<p>"What's Nokogiri?" Good question, I'm glad I asked it.
</p>

<p>Nokogiri is the best damn XML/HTML parsing library out there in Rubyland. What makes it so good? You can search by XPath. You can search by CSS. You can search by both XPath <i>and</i> CSS. Plus, it uses <a href='http://xmlsoft.org/'>libxml2</a> as the parsing engine, <a href='http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2007/05/09/xml-parser-benchmarks-part-1.html'>so it's fast</a>. But the best part is, it's got a dead-simple interface that we shamelessly lifted from <a href='http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/hpricot/'>Hpricot</a>, everyone's favorite delightful parser.
</p>

<p>I had big plans to do a series of posts with examples and benchmarks, but right now I'm in <a href='http://www.google.com/search?q=dst+hell'>DST Hell</a> and don't have the quality time to invest.
</p>

<p>So, as I am wont to do, I'm punting. Thankfully, Aaron was his usual prolific self, and has kindly provided lots of documentation and examples:
