h1. AintaBlog: Open Source Tumblogging

h3. "aintablog.com":http://aintablog.com

Aintablog is an open source blogging platform that attempts to combine the cooler parts of tumblr with more traditional blogging mainstays (commenting anyone?) It's not done. It's really not done.

Still, certain things work. You can create new posts (or as we call them, “articles”), quotes, and even import your Twitter/Flickr/del.icio.us feeds.

This app isn't quite for beginners (yet?). You need to know your way around a Rails app to really get going. With that being said, if you know Rails, then this app should be a piece of cake.

So fork away, and let me know if you add anything cool.

h3. REQUIREMENTS

You're going to need the feed-normalizer and hpricot gems.

  sudo gem install feed-normalizer hpricot

If you want to run the test suite, you'll need the mocha gem.

  sudo gem install mocha

I think that's about it.

You can run @rake gems:install@ to do it all in one fell swoop if you'd like.

h4. Defensio Spam Protection

Aintablog now has built-in Defensio Spam protection. You need to get API keys from "defensio.com":http://defensio.com, then put them into @config/defensio.yml@. If you don't want to use Defensio, you can set the "use_defensio" option to false in config/settings.yml.

h3. TODO

* Put together a better regex for the spanify_links helper
* -Page titles!-
* Page caching
* More control over posts (publish_at, -commentable?-)
* Graceful error handling if defensio key and/or yml file not present
* Info on initial account
* Test values are hardcoded
* Adding feeds easier (eg, "flickr username", "twitter username", etc)
* Retrieve posts when adding a feed
* Get tests to run
* Themes (templates + css)
